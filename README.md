foxDSP is a set of golang packages to be used within a console DSP programme. The intention is to keep the functionality limited to what is necessary and to keep the implementation simple. This is very much experimental work to see if it is possible to migrate SqueezeDSP away from c# and the dependency on InguzDSP.dll as this is becoming increasingly unmanageable

I have chosen to use golang because it is a statically typed portable language that was specifically designed to be fast and easy to use.
